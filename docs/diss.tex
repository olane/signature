\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

In this project I aimed firstly to implement at least two audio fingerprinting algorithms, each with a corresponding matching algorithm, for the purpose of recognising clips of songs from a library in a way that is robust to noise and distortions.

Secondly, I aimed to assemble a library of songs and corresponsing test clips against which to test these algorithms.

Finally, I aimed to compare these implementations against several criteria, including size of fingerprints generated and percentage of test clips matched correctly from the assembled library, at various clip lengths and levels of noise.

\section*{Work Completed}

Two implementations for audio fingerprinting algorithms were created, with corresponsing matching algorithms. These were the algorithms proposed by Avery Wang in 2003 \cite{Wang03} and Jaap Haitsma in 2002 \cite{Haitsma02}. A library of songs was assembled, and corresponding test cases made by taking different length clips from the library and adding distortions.

The implementations were tested and evaluated against the test cases and each other.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

None.
