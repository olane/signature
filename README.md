Signature
=========

This is my Part II project, investigating audio fingerprinting for song recognition.

Audio fingerprinting algorithms are a way of characterising the features of an audio file and using them to produce a condensed signature which summarises the content of the audio. They are best known for their ability to link unlabelled audio to corresponding metadata, regardless of the format of the audio. 

This project will focus on song identification against a predetermined library of music, and examine two audio fingerprinting algorithms to investigate their relative strengths and weaknesses.
